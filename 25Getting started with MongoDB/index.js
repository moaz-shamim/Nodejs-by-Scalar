/*
This code is using a JavaScript library called mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It imports the mongoose library using `require("mongoose")`. This allows the code to use mongoose's functionalities for interacting with MongoDB databases.

2. It calls the `connect()` method of mongoose, passing in the URL of the MongoDB database to connect to (`"mongodb://localhost:27017/scalar"`). This URL typically includes the protocol (`mongodb://`), the host (`localhost`), the port (`27017`), and the name of the database (`scalar` in this case).

3. The `.then()` method is used to handle a successful connection. Inside this method, it simply logs a message saying "Connection is Successfull".

4. The `.catch()` method is used to handle any errors that might occur during the connection process. Inside this method, it logs an error message along with the error object.

In simpler terms, this code tries to connect to a MongoDB database located on your local machine at port 27017 with the name "scalar". If the connection is successful, it logs a success message. If there's any problem connecting, it logs an error message.
