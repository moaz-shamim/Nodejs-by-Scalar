#    comparison query operators:

In MongoDB, comparison query operators are used to compare values within documents. These operators allow you to query documents based on specific conditions. Here are some common comparison query operators in MongoDB:

1. **$eq**: Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
   ```json
   { field: { $eq: value } }
   ```

2. **$ne**: Matches values that are not equal to a specified value.
   ```json
   { field: { $ne: value } }
   ```

3. **$gt**: Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
   ```json
   { field: { $gt: value } }
   ```

4. **$gte**: Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
   ```json
   { field: { $gte: value } }
   ```

5. **$lt**: Matches values that are less than a specified value.
   ```json
   { field: { $lt: value } }
   ```

6. **$lte**: Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
   ```json
   { field: { $lte: value } }
   ```

7. **$in**: Matches any of the values specified in an array.
   ```json
   { field: { $in: [value1, value2, ...] } }
   ```

8. **$nin**: Matches none of the values specified in an array.
   ```json
   { field: { $nin: [value1, value2, ...] } }
   ```

These operators can be used in conjunction with the `find()` method to query documents in a MongoDB collection based on specific criteria. For example:

```javascript
db.collection.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } }) // Retrieves documents where the "age" field is greater than 25.
db.collection.find({ name: { $eq: "John" } }) // Retrieves documents where the "name" field is equal to "John".
db.collection.find({ score: { $gte: 80, $lte: 90 } }) // Retrieves documents where the "score" field is between 80 and 90 (inclusive).
db.collection.find({ status: { $in: ["active", "pending"] } }) // Retrieves documents where the "status" field is either "active" or "pending".
```

# comparison query operators:

These are just a few examples of how comparison query operators can be used in MongoDB to query documents based on specific conditions.


In MongoDB, logical query operators allow you to perform more complex queries by combining multiple conditions. These operators help you specify logical conditions such as AND, OR, and NOT. Here are the main logical query operators in MongoDB:

1. **$and**: Joins query clauses with a logical AND and returns all documents that match the conditions.
   ```json
   { $and: [ { condition1 }, { condition2 }, ... ] }
   ```

2. **$or**: Joins query clauses with a logical OR and returns all documents that match at least one of the conditions.
   ```json
   { $or: [ { condition1 }, { condition2 }, ... ] }
   ```

3. **$not**: Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns documents that do not match the specified condition.
   ```json
   { field: { $not: { $eq: value } } }
   ```

4. **$nor**: Joins query clauses with a logical NOR and returns all documents that fail to match both conditions.
   ```json
   { $nor: [ { condition1 }, { condition2 }, ... ] }
   ```

These logical query operators can be used to create more complex queries that combine multiple conditions. Here are some examples of how these operators can be used:

```javascript
// Retrieves documents where both "age" is greater than 25 and "gender" is "male".
db.collection.find({ $and: [ { age: { $gt: 25 } }, { gender: "male" } ] })

// Retrieves documents where "status" is either "active" or "pending".
db.collection.find({ $or: [ { status: "active" }, { status: "pending" } ] })

// Retrieves documents where "age" is not equal to 30.
db.collection.find({ age: { $not: { $eq: 30 } } })

// Retrieves documents where "age" is less than 25 or "gender" is not "female".
db.collection.find({ $or: [ { age: { $lt: 25 } }, { gender: { $not: { $eq: "female" } } } ] })
```

These examples demonstrate how logical query operators in MongoDB can be used to build more sophisticated queries by combining multiple conditions using logical AND, OR, NOT, and NOR operations.
