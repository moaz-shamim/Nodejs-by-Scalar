Certainly! Let's walk through the code flow of the provided script:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The script begins by requiring the `fs` module.
   - It then logs "First Line" to the console.

2. **`fs.readFile("f1.txt", cb1)`**:
   - This line initiates a non-blocking I/O operation to read the contents of "f1.txt".
   - The callback `cb1` is provided to handle the result of this operation.
   - The control flow moves on immediately without waiting for the file read operation to complete.

3. **Synchronous Code Execution**:
   - The script proceeds synchronously and logs "Last Line" to the console.
   - Then, it defines `cb1`, `cb2`, and `cb3` functions.

4. **`cb1` Execution**:
   - After the synchronous code execution, the file reading operation for "f1.txt" is completed.
   - `cb1` is then pushed into the callback queue by the Node.js event loop.
   - When the call stack is empty, `cb1` is picked up from the callback queue and executed.
   - Inside `cb1`, the error is checked first. If there's no error, it logs the data from "f1.txt" to the console.
   - Then, it initiates another file reading operation to read "f2.txt" by calling `fs.readFile("f2.txt", cb2)`.

5. **`cb2` Execution**:
   - After `cb1` has initiated the read operation for "f2.txt", it immediately returns.
   - Then, the control flow continues to the next line of code which defines `cb2`.
   - `cb2` is similarly pushed into the callback queue after the file reading operation for "f2.txt" is completed.
   - When the call stack is empty, `cb2` is picked up from the callback queue and executed.
   - Inside `cb2`, the error is checked, and if there's no error, it logs the data from "f2.txt" to the console.
   - Finally, it initiates another file reading operation to read "f3.txt" by calling `fs.readFile("f3.txt", cb3)`.

6. **`cb3` Execution**:
   - After `cb2` has initiated the read operation for "f3.txt", it immediately returns.
   - Then, the control flow continues to the next line of code which defines `cb3`.
   - `cb3` is similarly pushed into the callback queue after the file reading operation for "f3.txt" is completed.
   - When the call stack is empty, `cb3` is picked up from the callback queue and executed.
   - Inside `cb3`, the error is checked, and if there's no error, it logs the data from "f3.txt" to the console.

7. **Completion**:
   - After `cb3` is executed, there are no more tasks in the callback queue.
   - The event loop continues to monitor for any pending tasks.

8. **Program End**:
   - Since there are no more pending tasks, the script ends.

**Final Output (assuming all file reads are successful)**:
```
First Line
Last Line
File 1 Data : <Content of f1.txt>
File 2 Data : <Content of f2.txt>
File 3 Data : <Content of f3.txt>
```

This script demonstrates the asynchronous nature of Node.js, where file read operations don't block the execution of subsequent code. Instead, they are executed asynchronously, and their corresponding callback functions are called when the operations are completed.
